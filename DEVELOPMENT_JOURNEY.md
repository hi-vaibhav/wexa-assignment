- JWT tokens with expiration
- Role-based access control
- Input validation with Zod
- Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
```

#### **2. Data Protection**
```javascript
// Security measures:

## üé§ Interview Presentation Script

### **Opening (2 minutes)**
*"I built a Smart Helpdesk system that demonstrates AI-powered automation in a real-world application. The system automatically triages support tickets using an AI agent that classifies tickets, searches knowledge base articles, generates responses, and decides whether to auto-resolve or assign to human agents."*

### **Technical Architecture (3 minutes)**
*"The system uses a MERN stack with TypeScript throughout. On the backend, I implemented a 5-step agentic AI workflow: Plan, Classify, Retrieve, Draft, and Decide. The frontend is a responsive React application with role-based dashboards. I used MongoDB for flexible data modeling and implemented queue-based processing for scalability."*

### **Key Technical Challenges (3 minutes)**
*"The biggest challenge was orchestrating the multi-step AI workflow while maintaining reliability. I solved this by implementing a state machine approach with comprehensive error handling and audit logging. I also built a dual-mode queue system that works with Redis in production but falls back to in-process processing for development."*

### **Unique Features (2 minutes)**
*"What makes this special is the complete observability - every action has a trace ID, comprehensive audit logging, and real-time status updates. The AI system is production-ready with confidence scoring, fallback strategies, and human-in-the-loop capabilities when AI confidence is low."*

### **Closing (1 minute)**
*"This project demonstrates my ability to build enterprise-grade applications with modern technologies, handle complex business logic, and create scalable, maintainable systems. The code is production-ready with comprehensive testing, security best practices, and thorough documentation."*
