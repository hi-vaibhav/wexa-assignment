A 500 Internal Server Error indicates a problem with our servers. Here's how to address it:

## Immediate Steps

1. **Refresh the page**
   - Wait 30 seconds and try again
   - Sometimes it's a temporary issue

2. **Clear browser cache**
   - Press Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
   - This forces a fresh page load

3. **Try incognito/private mode**
   - This eliminates browser extension conflicts

## If the error persists

1. **Check our status page**
   - Visit status.ourservice.com
   - Look for any ongoing incidents

2. **Try a different browser**
   - This helps identify browser-specific issues

3. **Contact support**
   - Include the exact error message
   - Mention what you were trying to do
   - Provide your browser and operating system

Our API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage:

## Rate Limits

- **Free tier**: 1,000 requests per hour
- **Pro tier**: 10,000 requests per hour
- **Enterprise**: Custom limits

## Headers

Check these response headers:
- \`X-RateLimit-Limit\`: Your rate limit
- \`X-RateLimit-Remaining\`: Requests remaining
- \`X-RateLimit-Reset\`: When the limit resets

## Best Practices

1. **Implement exponential backoff**
2. **Cache responses when possible**
3. **Use webhooks instead of polling**
4. **Batch requests when available**

## Error Handling

When rate limited (429 status):
- Wait for the reset time
- Don't retry immediately
- Implement proper error handling
